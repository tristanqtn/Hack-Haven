# Introduction To Pentest

This challenge can be used to showcase the basics of penetration testing to beginners. The goal is to find the flag in the server. Here's the installation guide:

## Installation

1. Download the virtual machine image from [here](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/metasploitable-1,28/)

2. Import the image in VirtualBox by creating a new virtual machine and selecting the downloaded disk as VM disk.

3. Set the network adapter to `NAT Network` in the VM settings. This will allow you to connect the VM to the Internet and to the attack device in a private and isolated network.

4. Start the VM and wait for it to boot.

5. Start the attack VM (Kali Linux) and connect it to the same NAT Network as the Metasploitable VM.

## Flag

Define a flag in the `flag.txt` file on the server. You can use the following command to create the file:

```
echo "SECRET: {FLAG}" > /root/flag.txt
```

## Usage

Provide the participants a session on the Kali Linux machine and ask them to find the flag on the Metasploitable VM. Provide them with the following instructions:
